        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>

        <li>1 ¾ cups milk, warmed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups cooked chicken, chopped</li>
        <li>8 ounces deli ham, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in cream cheese until it begins to melt, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, onion powder, and black pepper. Gradually whisk warm milk into cream cheese until smooth; stir in 1 ½ cups Swiss cheese. Bring sauce to a simmer, stirring constantly, until cheese has melted and sauce has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Spread ¾ cup cheese sauce into the bottom of a 9x9-inch baking dish. Arrange ⅓ lasagna noodles over sauce; spread ½ cooked chicken and ½ ham over noodles. Pour 1 cup sauce over top. Repeat layers starting with ½ remaining lasagna noodles, remaining ½ chicken, remaining ½ ham, and 1 cup cheese sauce. Layer on remaining lasagna noodles, remaining sauce, remaining ½ cup Swiss cheese, and bread crumbs; sprinkle top with Italian seasoning. Cover dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 25 minutes. Remove foil; continue baking until bread crumbs are browned, about 10 minutes more. Let casserole stand before serving, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
